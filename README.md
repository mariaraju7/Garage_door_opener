# Temperature Controlled Garage_door_opener:
# Developed control system on STM32L476 microcontroller in C, along with accelerometer, stepper motor, and temperature sensor that opens garage door when the temperature (23 deg>) is too high.
# Configured system peripherals including the system clock (80 MHz), UART for serial communication, SysTick timer, and GPIO for stepper motor control.
